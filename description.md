# What is Clickhouse?

ClickHouse manages extremely large volumes of data in a stable and sustainable manner. It currently 
powers Yandex.Metrica, world’s second largest web analytics platform, with over 13 trillion database 
records and over 20 billion events a day, generating customized reports on-the-fly, directly from 
non-aggregated data. This system was successfully implemented at CERN’s LHCb experiment to store and 
process metadata on 10bn events with over 1000 attributes per event registered in 2011.
